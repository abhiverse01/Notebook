# Notebook
# This is a notebook project which i'm trying to build whose interface is supposed to be like VScode
This project is developed to create a notebook using python and tkinter library. 
It's interface is designed to be similar to a VScode homepage
It has two sections in the note page. The writing section as well as the notes taking section, where notes, additonal citations etc for any file could be stored.
It has a homepage whose is supposed to have a create note section as well as the history of recently created and edited apps.
